The app uses Streamlit for the frontend, allowing users to select prompts from a CSV file to generate images using the Replicate API.

Here is the repo to be forked: https://github.com/mannurkishorreddy/streamlit-replicate-img-app
It retrieves necessary API tokens and endpoints from a .streamlit/secrets.toml. Please check the README on how to replace with your own tokens

A function convert_to_jpeg converts the generated image to JPEG format.

The save_image_to_github function uploads the JPEG image to a specified GitHub repository, encoding the image in base64.

The images are saved in two formats (1:1) and (2:39:1) as square and wide respectively.

The main function (main) handles the UI elements, image generation process, and calls the saving function upon user interaction.
